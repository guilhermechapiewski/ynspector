The main difference is that Rails migrations are intended to be used only on Ruby projects while simple-db-migrate makes it possible to have migrations in any language (Java, Python, Ruby, PHP, whatever). This is possible because simple-db-migrate uses database's DDL (Data Definition Language) to do the database operations, while Rails Migrations are written in a Ruby internal DSL.",
